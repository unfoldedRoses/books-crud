Node.js Book Management Project

This document provides instructions on how to start, clone, and run the Node.js Book Management Project. This project involves managing books using a MongoDB database. Below are the steps to get started.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

    Node.js: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
    MongoDB: Install and run MongoDB. You can download it from mongodb.com.

Cloning the Project

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
    Run the following command to clone the project from the GitHub repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git

Running the Project

    After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd nodejs-book-management

    Install project dependencies using npm. Run the following command:

bash

npm install

    Create a .env file in the project directory with the following content:

plaintext

MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with your MongoDB connection string.

    Start the Node.js server using the following command:

bash

npm start

    The server should now be running, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

    app.js: The main application file.
    config/dbConfig.js: Configuration for connecting to the MongoDB database.
    routes/bookRoutes.js: Define the API routes for book management.
    controller/bookController.js: Controller for handling book-related operations.
    models/Book.js:

     Defines the book schema for MongoDB.
    .env: Configuration file for environment variables.

Using the API

You can interact with the API endpoints as follows:

    POST /books/add-book: Add a new book.
    GET /books/all: Get a list of all books.
    GET /books/get-by-id/:id: Get a book by its ID.
    PUT /books/update-book/:id: Update a book's summary.
    DELETE /books/delete-book/:id: Delete a book by its ID.

Make API requests using a tool like Postman or curl.

That's it! You have successfully cloned and run the Node.js Book Management Project. You can start managing books using the provided API endpoints.

Remember to replace your-mongodb-connection-string in the .env file with your actual MongoDB connection string.
